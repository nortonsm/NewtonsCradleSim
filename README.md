# Newton's Cradle Simulation

This repository contains a C++ program that simulates a Newton's Cradle, using the SFML library for graphics.

## Features

- Graphical simulation of balls suspended by strings that collide elastically.
- User can drag and drop any ball to observe different outcomes.
- Demonstrates pendulum motion, elastic collisions, and momentum transfer.

## Dependencies

- **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
  - On macOS, you can install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or download from [SFML website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).

### Installing SFML on macOS (via Homebrew)

1. Install Homebrew if you haven't (visit https://brew.sh).
2. In a terminal, run:
   ```bash
   brew update
